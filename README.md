# haskell-game-of-life

## Overview
The Haskell Game of Life is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This project is more than just an implementation of the game; it's an exploration of functional programming paradigms, Haskell's powerful features, and software engineering great practices.

## Goals
Our primary objectives with this project are:

1. **Implementing Conway's Game of Life Logic**: At the core of this project lies the implementation of the game's logic using pure functional programming principles inherent to Haskell.

2. **Creating a Text-based UI with `brick`**: Utilizing the `brick` library, the project aims to offer an interactive text-based interface. This interface allows users to view the evolution of the game state in real-time within their terminal.

3. **Focus on Test-Driven Development**: Emphasizing software reliability, the project integrates extensive testing, including unit tests with HUnit and property tests with QuickCheck.

4. **Seamless Installation and Usage**: Ensuring easy setup, the project is structured to be effortlessly installable and runnable using Stack or Cabal, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

5. **Documentation and Community Engagement**: Comprehensive documentation and guidelines are provided, encouraging community contributions and feedback.

## Installation and Running

Instructions for installing and running the application using Stack or Cabal will be provided here.
