# Conway's Game in Haskell

## Overview
This project implements Conway's Game of Life using Haskell. The Game of Life, a zero-player game, evolves based on its initial configuration without further human input. Users set up an initial state and watch it evolve. Haskell's strong type system and pure functional programming are ideal for accurately modeling this cellular automaton.

## Game Description
The Game of Life is played on an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, each alive or dead. Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent). The evolution follows these rules:
- **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
- **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive.
- **Death**:
  - **Overpopulation**: A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
  - **Loneliness**: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.

## Goals
1. **Mathematical Fidelity**: Implement the game's rules accurately, ensuring the simulation behaves as Conway designed.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Use Haskell's lazy evaluation and efficient data structures for better performance, especially with large grids.
3. **Interactive Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface for initial configuration and simulation control, with text-based or graphical displays.
4. **Educational Value**: Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for educational purposes, explaining the code and the concepts behind the Game of Life.
5. **Extensibility**: Design the codebase to be modular for easy modifications, rule variations, or system integrations.
6. **Community Involvement**: Foster an open-source community for ongoing improvement and diverse use cases.

## Conclusion
By meeting these objectives, the project will not only offer an efficient Conway's Game of Life implementation in Haskell but also serve as an educational tool for functional programming and cellular automata enthusiasts.
